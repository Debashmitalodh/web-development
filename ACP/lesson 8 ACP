        Bangladesh's history encompasses ancient kingdoms and empires, Muslim rule, British colonial rule, and a
        struggle for
        independence. The region, formerly known as Bengal, was a center for Hindu and Buddhist dynasties before the
        arrival of
        Islam in the 8th century. The region became part of the Mughal Empire and later the British East India Company,
        experiencing significant economic and political changes. After the partition of British India in 1947, East
        Bengal
        became East Pakistan, leading to a war of independence in 1971 and the birth of Bangladesh.
